# PyDictionary by ne0mesys 
*This is my first script, I hope you guys enjoy it :)* 

## Welcome

This is my first made ethical hacking tool that allows users to generate dictionaries for cybersecurity purposes. 

The software enables penetration testers to input personal data of a target in order to create a massive number of combinations, resulting in a comprehensive custom dictionary. It currently allows users to enter input for ***name***, ***surname***, ***second_surname***, ***nickname***, ***second_nickname***, ***day_of_birth***, ***month_of_birth*** & ***year_of_birth***. This software also includes, a large amount of pre-defined data stored in several lists in order to create a more sophisticated dictionary. However, it will soon be updated in order to allow more and more inputs, since the more inputs it has, the bigger and more precise the dictionary is. All the libraries used in this software are part of the Python standard library. Therefore, no individual installation is required. 

You are welcome to taste it, download it and improve it yourself! However, REMEMBER to stay tuned for the next updates... 

This tool is developed strictly for educational and ethical purposes. I DO NOT take any responsibility for the misuse of this tool.

## Usage 

The usage of this software is quite simple. However, for those who prefer reading the documentation first, here is a quick guide ;)

* Type 'none' when there is no data to enter, so the software does not take the input.
