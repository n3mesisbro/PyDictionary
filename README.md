## Welcome

This is my first made ethical hacking tool that allows users to generate dictionaries for cybersecurity purposes. 

The software enables penetration testers to input personal data of a target in order to create a massive number of combinations, resulting in a comprehensive custom dictionary. The current version of the software is v1.0. It currently allows users to enter input for ***name***, ***surname***, ***second_surname***, ***nickname***, ***second_nickname***, ***day_of_birth***, ***month_of_birth*** & ***year_of_birth***. However, it will soon be updated in order to allow more and more inputs, since the more inputs it has, the bigger and more precise the dictionary is.

You are welcome to taste it, download it and improve it yourself! However, REMEMBER to stay tuned for the next updates... 

This tool is developed strictly for educational and ethical purposes. I DO NOT take any responsibility for the misuse of this tool.
