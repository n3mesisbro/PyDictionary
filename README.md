# PyDictionary by N3mesis 
This is my first made ethical hacking tool that allows users to generate dictionaries for cybersecurity purposes. 

The software, allows penetration testers to input personal data of a target in order to create a massive number of combinations, resulting in a comprehensive custom dictionary. This tool is developed strictly for educational and ethical purposes. I do not take any responsibility for the misuse of this tool.
